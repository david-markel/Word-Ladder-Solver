# Word-Ladder-Solver
Python application that takes two words and finds the shortest path of a chain of real words connected by changing one letter at a time

Enter in starting word, followed by target word. CAUTION: This program will run indefinitely if there is no solution, which is entirely possible. Make sure both words are of the same length. 

Example run:
